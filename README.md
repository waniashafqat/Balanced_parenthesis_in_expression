# Balanced_parenthesis_in_expression
### Python program to check expression for balanced parenthesis using stack.

The program asks the user to enter an expression consisting of parenthesis. It then removes any strings in between parenthesis, then stores the parenthesis in a stack, executes and checks whether the expression has **balanced parenthesis** or not.   
The program is implemented using *stacks*. It applies to nested as well as non-nested parenthesis.   

**FOR EXAMPLE:**  
If the user enters *" [ ] "* or *" { ( ) } ( { } ( ) ) "*, the output console will display:   
***"The expression has balanced parenthesis."***  
Whereas, if the user enters *" ( } "* or *" { ( ) { } ] "*, the output console will display:  
***"The expression does not have balanced parenthesis."***
