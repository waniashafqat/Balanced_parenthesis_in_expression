# Balanced_parenthesis_in_expression
### Python program to check expression for balanced parenthesis using stack.

The program asks the user to enter an expression consisting of parenthesis. It then executes and checks whether the expression has **balanced parenthesis** or not.  
The program is implemented using *stacks*.

**FOR EXAMPLE:**  
If the user enters *" [ ] "* or *" { ( ) } ( { } ( ) ) "*, the output console will display:   
***"The expression has balanced parenthesis."***  
Whereas, if the user enters *" ( } "* or *" { ( ) { } ] "*, the output console will display:  
***"The expression does not have balanced parenthesis."***
